   <h1>Intersection Observer API</h1>
   <p>The Intersection Observer API provides a way to asynchronously observe changes in the intersection of a target element with an ancestor element or with a top-level document's</p>
   <p>Intersection information is needed for many reasons</p>
   <ul>
      <li>Lazy-loading of images or other content as a page is scrolled.</li>
      <li>Implementing "infinite scrolling" web sites, where more and more content is loaded and rendered as you scroll, so that the user doesn't have to flip through pages.</li>
      <li>Reporting of visibility of advertisements in order to calculate ad revenues</li>
      <li>Deciding whether or not to perform tasks or animation processes based on whether or not the user will see the result.</li>
   </ul>

      <p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>
